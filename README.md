# John's Dotfiles

## How to use
```sh
# Clone the repository into "~/.dotfiles".
$ git clone https://github.com/jhnbrn90/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles

# Run the installation script.
$ ./install.sh

# Restart the computer.
```

### Install Adobe & JetBrains products
These dotfiles installed [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html) and 
[JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/), but no other Adobe or JetBrains products. I recommend you use the
Creative Cloud and Toolbox apps to install the programs you need.

### Configure PhpStorm settings
If you're using PhpStorm, [configure the settings repository](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/sharing-your-ide-settings.html#settings-repository)
to automatically apply [all my settings](https://github.com/svenluijten/phpstorm-settings).

## Disclaimer
I pieced these dotfiles together from various sources, most of which are attributed in comments throughout the source code. I am not
